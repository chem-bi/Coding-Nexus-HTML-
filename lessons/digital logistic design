lesson 1: Introduction to Digital Logic Design
1. What is Digital Logic Design?
Digital Logic Design is a branch of electronics engineering that deals with creating circuits to perform specific logical functions. These circuits are the building blocks of computers, smartphones, and other digital devices, allowing them to process binary information (0s and 1s). This lesson introduces the students to the world of digital circuits and lays a foundation for understanding more complex digital systems.
2. Importance and Applications of Digital Logic Design
Digital logic is essential because it enables complex decision-making processes in electronic devices. These systems are embedded in everyday technology, like mobile devices, computers, and home appliances. Learning Digital Logic Design can open pathways to designing microprocessors, memory devices, and other critical digital components.
3. Basic Concepts in Digital Logic Design
Binary System: In digital logic, the binary system (base-2) is the primary way of representing data. Instead of ten digits (0-9) like in the decimal system, it only has two (0 and 1).
Bits and Bytes: A bit is the smallest unit of data, representing a binary value of either 0 or 1. A byte consists of 8 bits, which can represent 256 possible values (2^8).
4. Types of Logic in Digital Design
Digital Logic is generally divided into combinational and sequential logic:

Combinational Logic: Circuits where the output depends solely on the current inputs. Examples include basic arithmetic operations, like addition and multiplication.
Sequential Logic: Circuits where the output depends on both current and previous inputs, introducing the concept of memory. Examples include counters and flip-flops.
5. Logic Gates and Their Function
Logic gates are the basic building blocks in digital logic circuits, each performing a unique logical operation. They take binary inputs and produce binary outputs based on specific rules. Here are the most common logic gates:

AND Gate: Outputs 1 only when all inputs are 1.
OR Gate: Outputs 1 when any input is 1.
NOT Gate: Outputs the opposite of the input (1 becomes 0, and vice versa).
NAND, NOR, XOR, XNOR: Variations that perform more complex operations.


Example 1: Binary to Decimal Conversion
To convert the binary number 1101 to decimal:

Write out the binary number with place values, starting from the right:
1√ó2^3=8
1√ó2^2=4
0√ó2^1=0
1√ó2^0=1

Add these values together: 
8+4+0+1=13
So, 1101 in binary is 13 in decimal


Lesson 2: Number Systems and Codes

This lesson introduces different number systems essential to digital logic, such as binary, decimal, octal, and hexadecimal, and the importance of understanding how to work between these systems. Digital systems use binary as their core language because they operate using two states: ON and OFF (1 and 0). For ease of use, however, other systems like octal and hexadecimal can be used to simplify representation of binary numbers.

This lesson also covers coding schemes like Binary Coded Decimal (BCD) and Gray code, which are used for efficient and accurate data processing, storage, and transmission in digital circuits.

Key Concepts and Examples
1. Binary System (Base-2)
Description: Uses only two digits, 0 and 1. Each binary digit represents a power of 2.
Example: Binary number 1010 in decimal is calculated as:
(1√ó2^3)+(0√ó2^2)+(1√ó2^1)+(0√ó2^0)=8+0+2+0=10
Application: Since digital electronics operate in binary, understanding binary conversions and arithmetic is foundational for working with digital logic circuits.

2. Decimal System (Base-10)
Description: Commonly used in everyday life, consisting of digits from 0 to 9.
Example: Decimal 57 remains 57 in this system.
Relevance: Although not directly used in digital circuits, learning to convert between decimal and binary is essential for understanding how computers interpret decimal-based human inputs.

3. Octal System (Base-8)
Description: Uses eight symbols (0 to 7). Each octal digit represents a power of 8.
Example: The octal number 12 represents:
(1√ó8^1)+(2√ó8^0)=8+2=10¬†in¬†decimal

Application: Octal is sometimes used to simplify binary, as each octal digit represents three binary digits, making conversions quicker.

4. Hexadecimal System (Base-16)
Description: Uses sixteen symbols (0‚Äì9 and A‚ÄìF, where A = 10, B = 11, etc.). Each hexadecimal digit represents a power of 16.
Example: The hexadecimal number 1A is calculated as:
(1√ó16^1)+(10√ó16^0)=16+10=26¬†in¬†decimal
Application: Hexadecimal is popular in digital design and computing for its compact form, where four binary digits map to a single hexadecimal digit


lesson 2: Conversions Between Number Systems
Conversions Between Number Systems
1. Decimal to Binary

Example: Convert decimal 13 to binary.
Divide 13 by 2 repeatedly, recording remainders:
13√∑2=6¬†remainder¬†1‚áí6√∑2=3¬†remainder¬†0‚áí3√∑2=1¬†remainder¬†1‚áí1√∑2=0¬†remainder¬†1
Binary result (from last remainder to first): 1101

2. Binary to Decimal

Example: Convert binary 1101 to decimal.
Each binary digit is multiplied by a power of 2:
(1√ó2^3)+(1√ó2^3)+(0√ó2^1)+(1√ó2^0)=8+4+0+1=13


3. Binary to Hexadecimal

Example: Convert binary 11010110 to hexadecimal.
Split into groups of four bits from the right: 1101 and 0110.
1101 maps to D and 0110 maps to 6, so the hexadecimal result is D6.


lesson 2: Coding Schemes

1. Binary Coded Decimal (BCD)
Description: BCD is a method of encoding decimal numbers where each digit is represented by its own 4-bit binary code.
Example: For the decimal 59:
5 in binary is 0101, and 9 is 1001.
BCD representation of 59 is 0101 1001.
Use: BCD is used in digital displays and calculators, as it is easy to convert between BCD and decimal.

2. Gray Code
Description: A binary numbering system where only one bit changes between consecutive numbers, reducing errors in digital communication.
Example: Decimal 0 to 3 in Gray Code: 00, 01, 11, 10
Use: Used in digital encoders, especially in mechanical systems where minimizing errors is crucial.


Lesson 3: Boolean Algebra
This lesson introduces Boolean Algebra, a mathematical framework for analyzing and simplifying digital logic circuits. Boolean Algebra provides the rules and techniques to express logical operations mathematically, helping to design efficient digital systems. We'll cover the basic operations and laws of Boolean Algebra, explore De Morgan's theorems, and practice simplifying logic expressions.

lesson 3: Boolean Operations

Boolean Algebra uses three basic operations:

AND (represented by ¬∑ or multiplication)
OR (represented by +)
NOT (represented by overline{ } or an apostrophe ')

Example: For inputs 
A and ùêµ:

AND operation:
A‚ãÖB (only true if both A and B are true).

OR operation: 

A+B (true if either A or B is true).

NOT operation:
A' (the inverse of A; true if A is false).


lesson 3: Basic Boolean Laws
Boolean laws allow us to simplify complex expressions. Here are a few key laws:

Identity Law:
A+0=A (OR operation with 0 does not change the output)
A‚ãÖ1=A (AND operation with 1 does not change the output)

Null Law:
A+1=1 (anything OR‚Äôed with 1 is 1)
A‚ãÖ0=0 (anything AND‚Äôed with 0 is 0)

Idempotent Law:
A+A=A
A‚ãÖA=A

Complement Law:
A+A'=1 (a variable OR‚Äôed with its complement is always true)
A‚ãÖA'=0 (a variable AND‚Äôed with its complement is always false)

Double Negation Law:
(A ') ' =A (negating a variable twice returns it to its original state)



lesson 3: Associative Law
The associative law allows us to regroup variables without changing the result.
For AND: 
(A‚ãÖB)‚ãÖC=A‚ãÖ(B‚ãÖC)
For OR: 
(A+B)+C=A+(B+C)

Example: Simplify (A+B)+C using the associative law:

This can be written as 
A+(B+C), which doesn‚Äôt change the outcome but shows how variables can be grouped.

lesson 3:  Distributive Law

This law helps distribute one operation over another, similar to multiplication in arithmetic.
For AND over OR: 
A‚ãÖ(B+C)=(A‚ãÖB)+(A‚ãÖC)
For OR over AND: 
A+(B‚ãÖC)=(A+B)‚ãÖ(A+C)

Example: Simplify A‚ãÖ(B+C):

Applying distributive law: A‚ãÖB+A‚ãÖC

lesson 3:  De Morgan‚Äôs Theorems

De Morgan‚Äôs theorems provide rules for transforming expressions with NOT operations over AND and OR operations. They are especially useful for simplifying expressions with multiple inversions.

First Theorem:

(A‚ãÖB) ‚Ä≤=A ‚Ä≤ +B ‚Ä≤

Second Theorem:
(A+B) ‚Ä≤=A ‚Ä≤‚ãÖB ‚Ä≤

Example: Simplify (A+B) ‚Ä≤ using De Morgan‚Äôs second theorem:
(A+B) ‚Ä≤=A ‚Ä≤‚ãÖB ‚Ä≤


lesson 3: Simplifying Boolean Expressions
To put these laws into practice, we‚Äôll go through a step-by-step example to simplify a complex expression:

Example: Simplify 
A‚ãÖB+A‚ãÖB ‚Ä≤:

Apply the distributive law: 
1. A‚ãÖ(B+B ‚Ä≤)
2. Apply the complement law: B+B ‚Ä≤=1
3. So, A‚ãÖ1=A
4. Final result:A
